# ifusion

I was doing Medical Imaging for two years at the __Computer Vision Center of Barcelona, CVC__ (www.cvc.uab.es/), working side by side with __Dr. Petia Radeva__, a global leader in the field. 

## Besides my Master Thesis (https://bit.ly/2QvXhwm), ifusion was one of the most challenging projects I led while at the CVC:

__ifusion__ was a software solution for registration of intravascular and angiography images during cardiac catheterization due to stenosis. This software got sold to the company __Boston Scientific__ by the __Computer Vision Center__ and I was leading the technological transfer.
In short, I had to translate all the existing C++ code into a Matlab version to be delivered to the Boston Scientific. 

## I wrote a full description of the software, modules, functions, tests, etc. in the PDF uploaded in this repository:
