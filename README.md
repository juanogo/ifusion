# ifusion

I was doing Medical Imaging for two years at the __Computer Vision Center of Barcelona__ (www.cvc.uab.es/), working side by side with __Dr. Petia Radeva__, a global leader in the field. 

## Beside my Master Thesis (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-02172-5_33), iFusion was one of the most representative projects I led:

iFusion was a software solution for registration of intravascular and angiography images during cardiac catheterization due to stenosis. This software got sold to the company __Boston Scientific__ by the __Computer Vision Center__ and I was leading the technological transfer.
In short, I had to translate all the existing C++ code into a Matlab version to be delivered to the Boston Scientific. 

I wrote a full description of the software, modules, function, tests, etc. in the PDF uploaded in this repository.

Also, a video of my final Matlab-implementation can be watched here:
