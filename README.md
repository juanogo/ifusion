# ifusion

I was doing Medical Imaging for two years at the [__Computer Vision Center of Barcelona, CVC__](www.cvc.uab.es/), working side by side with __Dr. Petia Radeva__, a global leader in the field. 

### Besides my [Master Thesis](https://bit.ly/2QvXhwm), ifusion was one of the most challenging projects I led while at the CVC:

__ifusion__ was a software solution for registration of intravascular and angiography images during cardiac catheterization due to stenosis. This software got sold to the company __Boston Scientific__  and I had to lead the technological transfer process.

In short, I had to translate all the existing C++ code into a Matlab version to be delivered to the Boston Scientific. 

### I wrote a full description of the software, modules, functions, tests, etc. in the PDF uploaded here in this very repository:

### Also, a video of my final Matlab-implementation can be watched here:
